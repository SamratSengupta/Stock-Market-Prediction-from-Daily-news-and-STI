# Stock-Market-Prediction-from-Daily-news-and-STI
here the methodologies for developing a robust AI-based stock market
prediction model from Dow Jones Industrial exchange and Reddit news are implemented.
At first, we analyze techniques related to technical Indicators based on Stock
prediction. We hint to carry out time series-based EDA on DJIA data and derive
technical indicators based on the theories adapted in literature review and
observations from EDA. Next, we briefly analyze LSTM as our baseline model
and dive deep into tabnet architecture which is our proposed model for numerical
analysis.
Then we would move on to examine the exploratory analysis for Reddit newsbased articles and decides on the data cleaning operations to be performed. Post
that we examined Bert and Glove based embedding for text data followed by an
outline of CNN-LSTM architecture which is our baseline model and a more
critical analysis of capsule Transformer based network which is our proposed
model.
Finally, we proceed to describe the ensemble technique for our proposed models
(text and numerical based) to arrive at the outcome of our study.
